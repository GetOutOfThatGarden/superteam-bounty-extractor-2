Title: Roast the Non Citizens
URL: https://earn.superteam.fun/listing/roast-the-non-citizens
Reward: 2000 USDC
Sponsor: Badchain (Bandit Network)
Description: About Rome Protocol

Rome Protocol is turning Solana into the backbone of the entire multi-chain universe. It lets L2s and rollups tap into Solana speed, but still vibe with Ethereum, Bitcoin, Cosmos & more.

Think: EVM chains with Solana gas, instant finality, and atomic cross-chain magic.

They’re fixing liquidity messes, breaking chain silos, and making composability cool again.

Mission

"You Didn’t Mint Imperia? That’s Embarrassing."

Not everyone can be a Citizen. Some will be spectators. This bounty is your chance to roast those who will miss the Imperia: Rome Citizen NFT – the ones left outside the gates, weaponless, watching greatness from the sidelines.

We want creative, funny, brutal roasts targeting the non-believers:

The ones who won't mint.

The ones who “slept on it.”

The ones who called it “just another NFT.”

The ones who’ll cope when Citizens enter the arena.




Think gladiator memes, Roman shade, and history-book-level humiliation.

Scope Detail

Follow and tag Badchain and Rome Protocol on X in your submission.

Join Roaster X community and post your roast in that community.

Avoid botting for engagement or using AI-generated/plagiarized text content; such submissions will be disqualified.

Comment your submission on the bounty announcement.

Submission Requirements

If you’re posting a single roast tweet, simply comment @toobad_bot under your roast.

If you’re posting a roast thread, tag @toobad_bot at the end of the thread.

Submissions should be in the form of creative "roast" content.

Content must be original and based on actual product usage.

Submissions should be posted on X as specified.

Judging Criteria

Creativity: How original and "spicy" is the roast?

Style: Effective use of memes, punchlines, GIFs, and other engaging elements.

Bonus Points: Submissions that evoke both laughter and emotional impact.

Terms

This bounty aims to spread the word about Rome Protocol and Badchain Partnered Roast Campaign. Sponsors won’t provide individual feedback because we’ll be too busy laughing/crying at the entries. By entering, you confirm that you’re ready to roast responsibly.

All roast submissions reflect the personal opinions and experiences of individual participants. Badchain does not endorse or agree with any specific content. We simply provide the platform for expression.

You badMFs are fully responsible for your own words and deeds - roast responsibly (or don’t).

If anything blows up, Kevin from Legal will be in touch.
