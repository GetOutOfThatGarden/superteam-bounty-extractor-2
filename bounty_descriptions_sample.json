    "description": "About Rome Protocol\n\nRome Protocol is turning Solana into the backbone of the entire multi-chain universe. It lets L2s and rollups tap into Solana speed, but still vibe with Ethereum, Bitcoin, Cosmos & more.\n\nThink: EVM chains with Solana gas, instant finality, and atomic cross-chain magic.\n\nThey’re fixing liquidity messes, breaking chain silos, and making composability cool again.\n\nMission\n\n\"You Didn’t Mint Imperia? That’s Embarrassing.\"\n\nNot everyone can be a Citizen. Some will be spectators. This bounty is your chance to roast those who will miss the Imperia: Rome Citizen NFT – the ones left outside the gates, weaponless, watching greatness from the sidelines.\n\nWe want creative, funny, brutal roasts targeting the non-believers:\n\nThe ones who won't mint.\n\nThe ones who “slept on it.”\n\nThe ones who called it “just another NFT.”\n\nThe ones who’ll cope when Citizens enter the arena.\n\n\n\n\nThink gladiator memes, Roman shade, and history-book-level humiliation.\n\nScope Detail\n\nFollow and tag Badchain and Rome Protocol on X in your submission.\n\nJoin Roaster X community and post your roast in that community.\n\nAvoid botting for engagement or using AI-generated/plagiarized text content; such submissions will be disqualified.\n\nComment your submission on the bounty announcement.\n\nSubmission Requirements\n\nIf you’re posting a single roast tweet, simply comment @toobad_bot under your roast.\n\nIf you’re posting a roast thread, tag @toobad_bot at the end of the thread.\n\nSubmissions should be in the form of creative \"roast\" content.\n\nContent must be original and based on actual product usage.\n\nSubmissions should be posted on X as specified.\n\nResources\n\nWebsite: https://www.rome.builders/\n\nX: https://x.com/RomeProtocol\n\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/zU3dQXWb8w\n\nJudging Criteria\n\nCreativity: How original and \"spicy\" is the roast?\n\nStyle: Effective use of memes, punchlines, GIFs, and other engaging elements.\n\nBonus Points: Submissions that evoke both laughter and emotional impact.\n\nTerms\n\nThis bounty aims to spread the word about Rome Protocol and Badchain Partnered Roast Campaign. Sponsors won’t provide individual feedback because we’ll be too busy laughing/crying at the entries. By entering, you confirm that you’re ready to roast responsibly.\n\nAll roast submissions reflect the personal opinions and experiences of individual participants. Badchain does not endorse or agree with any specific content. We simply provide the platform for expression.\n\nYou badMFs are fully responsible for your own words and deeds - roast responsibly (or don’t).\n\nIf anything blows up, Kevin from Legal will be in touch.",
